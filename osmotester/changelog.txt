-fixed some bugs and did some refactoring to clarify code
v0.3 16/07/2011
-split oracle to pre and post methods
v0.4 02/08/2011

-fixed some bugs and did some optimizations
v1.0 24/08/2011
-This is the first version to provide some stable interface
-Cleaned up excess parameters from TestSuite and TestStep
